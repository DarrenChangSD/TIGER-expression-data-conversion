# TIGER-expression-data-conversion
Created in order to convert TIGER expression data from txt to csv form for the Oncogenomics Lab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are starting from scratch:
1) Take the download.py and parse_EST.py and put them into a desired directory.
2) Open command line and cd to the folder that contains these files.
3) First run "python download.py" in order to get tss_spf_rsc.txt file.
4) Once you have the txt file you can now run "python parse_EST.py".
5) Wait a little and now your csv file should be in the same directory.

***The CSV file has already been generated so no need to download and run***
